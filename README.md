Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project aimed to improve the process of obtaining a driver's license. They wanted a comprehensive sytem that would allow users to sign up for driving courses, schedule practice tests, and access study materials in one place. The system needed to be secure, scalable, and user friendly. 

What did you do particularly well?
I think I did pretty well at identifyiing the business requirements and everything that the client was asking for. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I could improve the business design document by making a better UML diagram that would include more details in the structure of the DriverPass program.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I focused on understanding the core goals. Simplifying the driver's license process, building trust, and ensuring accessibility. Designing with precision ensures the system isn't just functional but also meaningful. The client wants to build trust and reliablitly with their clients with the service they are providing.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
First start by clarifying the business goals, user needs and any constraints. Then define the requirements clearly for what the system should do. Modeling the system will be the next step in order to provide some visualization of the architecture. It will also be important to include design for security and scalability.
